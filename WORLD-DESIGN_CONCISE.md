# Vibe Guild — World Design (Concise)

## Essence Edition

Vibe Guild is an **autonomous AI operating world** designed to help FeatBit scale vibe marketing with high execution speed and low human coordination overhead.

Instead of a single AI assistant, Vibe Guild runs as a **living team of AI beings** with role memory, team collaboration, work/rest cadence, escalation rules, and resumable operations. You give a task once; the world keeps moving.

### Core Design Thesis

- **From prompts to operations**: The system is not just "chat + output"; it is a continuous operating loop.
- **From isolated agents to organized teams**: Beings self-organize, split work, elect leaders, and execute in parallel when needed.
- **From stateless calls to durable memory**: Memory exists at being, team, project, and world levels, with daily/weekly/monthly rollups.
- **From black-box automation to controllable autonomy**: Human checkpoints, meetup freeze/resume, and explicit escalation paths keep the operator in control.

### Why It Stands Out

1. **Shift-based autonomy**: 8-minute work + 2-minute rest per day (MVP), forcing structured summaries and reducing context drift.
2. **Multi-horizon memory**: Private self-notes + shared team/project records + world history for cumulative learning.
3. **Dynamic being pool**: The pool starts empty and grows entirely on demand — no upper limit. Each turn the engine checks which beings are free vs busy. Free beings are assigned first; when a task needs more capacity than is available, the Orchestrator creates new beings (from a template) automatically. Each being may only work on one task at a time.
4. **Human-in-the-loop by design**: Meetups can freeze all beings at atomic boundaries, let humans redirect, then resume exactly where work stopped.
5. **Self-improving capability layer**: Beings can create tools/skills, promote useful ones to `world/shared/`, and sync them into the world engine.

### Practical Outcome for FeatBit

Vibe Guild is built to continuously produce:

- trend monitoring across developer communities,
- structured insights around feature flags / experimentation / progressive delivery,
- practical application use cases and runnable scenarios for FeatBit,
- tutorials and hands-on guides that reduce adoption friction,
- demos and presentation-ready materials for sales, community, and partnership conversations,
- email sales assets, including outbound sequences, personalized outreach copy, and follow-up templates,
- content assets (blogs, reports, narratives) optimized for SEO and GEO growth,
- and escalation-ready decisions for the human operator.

In short: **an AI-native execution system for consistent marketing output, not one-off AI content generation.**

## Concise Edition

Vibe Guild is a persistent AI world for FeatBit marketing:

- **Mission**: turn trend signals into insights and content continuously.
- **Unit of execution**: Dynamic pool of AI beings — starts empty, grows on demand, no upper limit. Free beings are reused first; new ones are created when capacity is needed. One task per being at a time.
- **Cadence**: fixed work/rest shifts to enforce summaries and continuity.
- **Memory**: being/team/project/world layers + periodic rollups.
- **Control**: meetup freeze/resume + explicit escalation to human.
- **Growth loop**: beings build and share tools/skills to improve world capability over time.

**One-line pitch**: *Vibe Guild is an autonomous AI marketing ops world that works like a team, remembers like an organization, and reports like a disciplined operator.*
