# Project General Instructions

## Code of Conduct for AI Agents

This workspace use primarily typescript as the programming language, and markdown as the documentation language.

Do not write code as Object Oriented Programming, but rather as Functional Programming. This means that you should avoid using classes and instead use functions and modules to organize your code.

## AI Generation Rules

- All content generated by AI must be in English.
- You have to require permission before generating new markdown files.
- Use ASCIIDOC as the format for graphs and diagrams, and use Mermaid for flowcharts and sequence diagrams.

## Copilot Operational Guidance (Vibe Guild)

When the human asks for world runtime visibility (task queue, progress, escalations, day status),
Copilot should prefer the Vibe Guild Bash CLI first, then summarize the result.

Preferred commands:

- `node scripts/vg.mjs overview`
- `node scripts/vg.mjs tasks`
- `node scripts/vg.mjs tasks <status> [limit]`
- `node scripts/vg.mjs progress <taskId-or-prefix>`
- `node scripts/vg.mjs escalations [limit]`

Fallback policy:

1. Try `scripts/vg.mjs` first for low-token, operator-friendly output.
2. Only read raw files under `world/` when the CLI output is insufficient.
3. Keep summaries concise and action-oriented for the creator.
