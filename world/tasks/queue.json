    "description": "Go to the GitHub repository https://github.com/vibeguild/worlds-first-element. Your mission has two phases:\n\nPhase 1 - Discuss and decide: Each team member should create a GitHub issue in that repo, signed with their own name and role. Use the issues to discuss with each other: what kind of small program should we build in this repo? Propose ideas freely - it can be a game, a tool, a poem generator, anything creative. React to each other's proposals in issue comments. Reach a consensus on what to build.\n\nPhase 2 - Build it: Once the team agrees on an idea, implement it. Create the actual code files in the repo via the GitHub API (PUT /repos/vibeguild/worlds-first-element/contents/{path}). The program should be runnable and reflect the team's collective personality.\n\nUse the VIBEGUILD_GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable for all GitHub API calls. Sign everything with your being identity. Report completion with links to the issues and the created files.",
